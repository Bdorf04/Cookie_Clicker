# Cookie_Clicker Bot
## Made by Brett Dorfman

This Cookie Clicker bot automatically progresses you in the game, up until the temple. The ability to continue playing once the bot has run its course is possible. More automatic progress will be added soon.  

### How to Use this bot

1. Downlaod Python [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Downlaod Selenium [Here](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)

4. Download a webdriver. I use the chrome Webdriver, attached [Here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Keep in mind, some selenium versions and webdrivers force you to set up a path, but the newest selenium and webdriver versions do it automatically. 

3. Clone this repository, and run the bot!

Please keep in mind any progress done within the browser will be lost upon closing.

Another way to "hack" cookie clicker is to inspect element and run the command game.cookies={Number}

Happy clicking!!
